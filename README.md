Assignment for Coding For Economists class at Central European University. 07.04.2023.
I use the latest dataset from European Values Study (available from here: https://search.gesis.org/research_data/ZA7505), and with the help of the codebook (also available from here: https://search.gesis.org/research_data/ZA7505), I analyse relationship between income and participation in political protests. The dataset is too large for git, but can be downloaded from the link above.
When reading csv data in Stata I use the hotels-europe_price dataset from https://gabors-data-analysis.com/datasets/ and this dataset was also used in the excercise with Phyton.
